# dirty-data-litter-analyse
Project to use a smart litter picker to collect, record, and analyses the litter left on the street so that pragmatic solutions can be developed and explored. 

## Deliverables
- smart litter picker that auto counts and classifyes litter with location 
- dashboard that visulises the litter on a map of the street
- clean datasets to allow people to perform analyse of the data

## Outcomes
- some data driven approaches to reducing litter that could be scaled to other areas also
